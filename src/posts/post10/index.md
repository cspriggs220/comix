## 3 pack of Here's the Question

A funny comic that people will be laughing at in less than 2 minutes! And then will have it stuck in their head, it is so funny. So I recommend that you should get these every Sunday. It's a really good deal, just 25 cents a strip.

Now I'm going to tell you about what the comic 3 pack is about:
A kid named Jackson who is very into making funny stories and he makes these happen in real life. The one that isn't about "mad parents" is what he did in real life.

Have a good time with these great comic strips. In less than an hour I'll bet you will have more than 40 of these on your desk in room!

Thank you for reading.
