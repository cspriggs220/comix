## Divine Beast Vah Rudania

This is the 2nd Divine Beast that roams Death Mountain and attacks with its ancient fire relics!! It's huge body resembles a lizard corrupted by Calamity Ganon, the most feared monster of them all! The malice inside the main control room makes it difficult to reach the button that stops it. The Goron race loves mining on Death Mountain, but ever since Rudania was captured by the huge balls of malice shooting from the top of Hyrule castle, they were too scared to approach the volcano. Next comes Vah Ruta, the corrupted relic that has the appearance of an elephant!
