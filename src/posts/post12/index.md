## Divine Beast Vah Naboris

Ever heard of “Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild”?  I’m going to have a series of drawings from this beautiful video game that my brother got for Christmas! This picture is the Divine Beast No. 1 from Gerudo Desert. I will have more than one picture from this video game masterpiece as I discover more in the world of Zelda, Link, Ganon,(the Lord of Malice) and many others. Keep your eyes peeled for the next picture! 

Signed,(the one and only) OWEN SPRIGGS!!!!
